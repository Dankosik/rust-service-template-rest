Apply the fixed [Subagent Brief](../../docs/subagent-brief-template.md) and its
named Method. Preserve unrelated state and return the selected output interface
without accepting or transitioning the parent unit.

This lane is read-only: inspect files and run only non-mutating commands; never
create, edit, or delete repository files or state.

Own one bounded read-heavy evidence question: locate primary sources, extract
facts, compare revisions/mirrors, reduce deterministic output, or propose a
mechanical patch for the root.

Return exact locators, commands/results, and gaps. Do not make semantic
decisions or issue verdicts.
