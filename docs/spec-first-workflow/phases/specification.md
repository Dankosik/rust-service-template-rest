# Specification

Use when structured work lacks a ready behavior delta. Own what must be true
before selecting a mechanism.

Consume the requester-meaning authority selected by [Phase
Selection](../../spec-first-workflow.md#phase-selection), decision-changing
Research, current runtime, generated and consumer authority, stable decisions,
and current findings. Disposition every material requester-meaning item as accepted
behavior, deliberately unchanged behavior, a non-goal, or an upstream open
decision; never silently replace requester meaning. Reconstruct affected actors
and surfaces; record changed, removed, deliberately unchanged, and non-goal
behavior. Start with a coherent behavioral outline and apply Outcome,
Necessity, and Composition below before expanding per-rule detail. Develop
the same specification throughout; the outline adds no artifact or review gate.

Load only a method whose pressure changes observable meaning:

- client-visible REST semantics -> `rust-api-contract`;
- failure semantics, problem codes, or degradation -> `rust-errors`;
- trust, authorization, isolation, or sensitive data -> `rust-security`;
- deadlines, retries, readiness, or drain behavior -> `rust-reliability`.

Business transitions and persistence truth have no skill yet (their
capabilities arrive with their stages); the phase owner decides them from
[Repository Architecture](../../repo-architecture.md) and records the decision.

Outcome: Check whether all requirements could pass while the accepted
user outcome still fails; resolve any such gap.

Necessity: Trace each added requirement to accepted intent or a mandatory
constraint. Treat research recommendations as evidence, not accepted
requirements.

Composition: Check interacting rules together through a representative
user-visible scenario; resolve conflicts in terminology, precedence,
and outcomes.

Then apply [Material Rule](../rubrics/material-rule.md) to each materially
affected rule so scope, policy, invariants, compatibility, truth/finality,
failure, replay/recovery, and success meaning cannot diverge across two
reasonable implementations. Recheck any outline conclusions invalidated by
that detail; the completed contract remains the independent review boundary.

Return a compact behavioral contract and reference unchanged code, contracts,
tests, mockups, or evidence. Persist `spec.md` only through
[Artifacts](../shared/artifacts.md). Apply [Specification
Review](specification-review.md) through shared [Review](../shared/review.md).

Ready when every material requester-meaning item and divergence has one grounded
disposition and the next owner need not invent product meaning. Reopen Intake
when intent changes or is incomplete, Research for evidence, or the named policy
owner for its missing decision.
