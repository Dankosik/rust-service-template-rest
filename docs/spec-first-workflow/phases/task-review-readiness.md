# Task Review / Readiness

Use when shared [Review](../shared/review.md) routes one fixed inline unit or
persisted ledger, or the user explicitly requests standalone plan/readiness
review. This adapter owns only Planning falsifiers and threshold.

## Atomicity Gate

Before simulating execution, test whether the packet is one independently
acceptable repository outcome. Return `FAIL` to Planning and name the
boundaries when the packet contains more than one Outcome, or when it is only a
layer of another Outcome and cannot be consumed without still-planned companion
work. Independent implementation, investigation, or repair inside one
postcondition is not a split. Do not author the replacement ledger.

## Lenses

Simulate the next executable unit from selection through
implementation completion and its eventual final validation under [Ready
Frontier](planning/ledger-contract.md#ready-frontier), using only the fixed plan,
cited sources, and current evidence. Resolve prerequisites and handoffs, trace
canonical/generated order, locate non-obvious writable surfaces/resources, and
trace the expected user-visible outcome to the real path. Test cases, fixtures,
assertions, and exact commands are executor-owned choices; their absence does
not fail Planning review. Missing final integration evidence prevents
Completion only when the accepted claim requires it, without blocking
independent implementation. Optional integration evidence does not block local
completion.

Trace persisted artifact custody and status through each actor boundary; the
next actor must proceed from canonical state without chat reconstruction.

Falsify each changed contract/authority against current producers, consumers,
derived outputs, mirrors, proof carriers, and replacement surfaces. A companion
must be inside the unit, behind a dependency whose intermediate state remains
valid, or proved unchanged. Stop a blocked path at its earliest unrecorded choice
or unavailable input, but continue independent paths. Inspect later units only
for a decision/dependency that can invalidate the next accepted result.

Do not reslice tasks, author replacement packets, or choose missing behavior,
mechanism, ownership, rollout, authority, or concurrency. Do not turn this
review into a preliminary test-design exercise.

Review is a written walkthrough, without live checks. `PASS` requires the next
authorized implementation to be executable from closed product/design decisions,
with a clear final observable outcome and known external gates. `CONCERNS` may
carry only
a later bounded risk that cannot invalidate that result. Any hidden decision,
unavailable input required for the next implementation action, invalid split,
or undefined product outcome is `FAIL` and reopens Planning or the
smallest upstream owner.
