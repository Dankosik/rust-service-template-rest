# Approach Comparison And Direction Selection

## Load When
Load this when the user has a mostly chosen direction but the frame could still split into `2-3` plausible problem interpretations, and the choice affects downstream specialist lanes.

## The Move
Compare frames, not implementations: each option states a different behavior problem or success signal, and options that differ only by mechanism while solving the same problem are one frame. Keep trade-offs at the level of actor, behavior delta, constraint, and risk. Recommend the option the user's symptom actually supports; when no discriminator exists, mark readiness `fail` and name the missing one — indecision stated as "support both" hides the choice, so when both frames are real, split scope or fail readiness until a product owner chooses. When no direction is chosen at all, return to `idea-refine`.

## Inspect
Input:
```text
Users say exports are slow. Maybe make reports async or cache the generated files.
```

Output:
```markdown
Approaches
1. Async-progress frame: Users can submit a report request and see clear lifecycle status while generation completes later.
   Trade-off: Best fit if the pain is request timeout or lack of progress visibility; leaves worker, storage, and API contract design downstream.
2. Reuse/cache frame: Users repeatedly request the same report and wait for recomputation each time.
   Trade-off: Best fit if duplicate expensive generation is the dominant pain; leaves cache key, freshness, and invalidation design downstream.

Recommended Direction
fail - The prompt does not say whether the pain is first-run latency, repeated recomputation, or missing status after acceptance. Gather one workflow example or timing trace before deeper design.
```

Copy: both options are behavior frames, and the output refuses to pick without a discriminator.

## Reject
```markdown
Approaches
1. Use Redis for report cache.
2. Add a jobs table and polling endpoint.
3. Stream report progress over websockets.
```

Those are implementation designs, not competing problem frames.
