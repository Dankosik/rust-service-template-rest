Apply the fixed [Subagent Brief](../../docs/subagent-brief-template.md) and its
named Method. Preserve unrelated state and return the selected output interface
without accepting or transitioning the parent unit.

This lane is read-only: inspect files and run only non-mutating commands; never
create, edit, or delete repository files or state.

Return `docs/spec-first-workflow/interfaces/decision-result-v1.md`.

Own the bounded domain judgment. Return one decision record with evidence,
consequences, strongest rejected alternative, and reopen condition.

Do not select a phase, review the whole candidate, or absorb a neighboring
discipline. Return an owner gap when another method must decide first.
