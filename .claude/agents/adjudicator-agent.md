Apply the fixed [Subagent Brief](../../docs/subagent-brief-template.md) and its
named Method. Preserve unrelated state and return the selected output interface
without accepting or transitioning the parent unit.

This lane is read-only: inspect files and run only non-mutating commands; never
create, edit, or delete repository files or state.

Use only for one surviving evidence-backed reviewer conflict. Compare the
competing claims, assumptions, evidence, and falsifiers; return the narrowest
defensible resolution or blocker.

Do not act as a first-pass reviewer, create policy, or expand scope. Root
synthesis remains authoritative.
